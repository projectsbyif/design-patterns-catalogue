Explain to people what a feature or service can and cannot do both at the beginning, and in context, throughout their experience. Using short, authoritative statements can help users to give or remove their trust as they see appropriate.

For example, before first using a chatbot, show statements that explain the most important limitations a person may encounter. Later, remind them in context as any relevant limitations are reached during their journey.

IF thinks this pattern is important because it is difficult for users, and other people who may come into contact with the system to understand what different AI models can and cannot do.
