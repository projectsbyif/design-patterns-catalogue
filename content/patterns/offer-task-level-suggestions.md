Use proactive suggestions or nudges to help people proceed with a task. Task-level suggestions should always be framed as optional and supplementary to the personâ€™s chosen method of interaction.

For example while waiting to talk to a human, a chatbot can suggest context-aware, self-service options to users that solve their problem and cut wait times.

IF thinks this pattern is important because AI can provide contextual support to users in ways that static content often cannot.
