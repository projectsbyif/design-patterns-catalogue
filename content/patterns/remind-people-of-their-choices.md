Remind people of their choices at relevant moments such as at point-of-use or after long periods of inactivity.

For example, if someone previously allowed data about them to be shared with a third party, prompt them when new data is about to be transferred.

These contextual reminders can clarify, in context, why an action is happening based on earlier decisions, helping people understand how their preferences shape the service.

A Notice of upcoming action is a related pattern, reminding people ahead of time so they have space to review or change what they’ve allowed.

IF believes these reminders keep data-sharing decisions meaningful and aligned with people’s expectations over time.
